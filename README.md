## Inspiration
As a high school student, my peers and I constantly try to land an internship. What is usually necessary to apply? A resume. As teenagers, we do not have much experience with resumes and we had to go around asking many adults for help. This made us realize how difficult it could be to get help. This life experience inspired me to create Resumate. 

## What it does
Resumate is a website that critiques a section of the user's resume and gives advice on how it can be improved upon. 

## How I built it
This was built using the OpenAI API, Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I first made a wireframe of the website on Figma and then started coding it. I created all the Django files I would need for this project. Then, I started working on the template HTML files needed. I, then, started working on the technical aspects using the OpenAI API and Django. I used function-based views and connected them to the urls.py. 

## Challenges we ran into
First off, I really wanted a nicer UI and it was shown through my Figma wireframe. However, I ran out of time and was not able to code all of it using HTML and CSS. Second, I wanted to have more pages that went into detail about how resumes are impactful, but again, I ran out of time. Third, I had to put the API key into my code, but I did not want to share it since it is sensitive information. So, I learned how to use dotenv to hide it! 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This was my first time using an API so I am proud of the fact that I was able to learn something during this hackathon! 

## What I learned
I learned how to use an API. Adding to that, I learned how to use the key without showing it in my code. This was also the first time I've used a CSS framework. In this case, it was Bootstrap. I see why many people opt to use it since it gets the job done a lot faster. I would love to try out Tailwind CSS in the future. 

## What's next for Resumate
After the end of this hackathon, I would want to continue working on this project and polish it. I'd use HTML and CSS to code the UI that I initially wanted. I would also continue working on making the AI have more detailed answers by learning how to write better prompts.
